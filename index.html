          <h3>Wake Tech Community College- Raleigh NC</h3>
          <p>Web Design and Developer Student</p>
          <p>I have been in and out of college for 6 years with a lot of classes under my belt. In 2020 I decided to go back and get a degree in Computer Programming. This is when I discovered HTML/CSS and I loved it! I changed my degree and I have been working very hard. I am a full time student and at this rate I will graduate in the spring of 2022. I made Dean's List this past semester and was invited to be a Student Ambassador. I am proud how far I have come and I am hoping to land a good job next year.</p>
